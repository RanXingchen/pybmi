class KalmanFilter():
    """
    Kalman filter for brain computer interface (BCI) decoding.

    This Kalman filter is designed for BCI decoding. You can
    use it to predict the target's future location by decoding
    the corresponding neural signal. In this framework, the
    target data (like position, velocity or acceleration, etc.)
    is modeled as the system state and the neural signal is
    modeled as the observation (measurement). Note that to use
    this Kalman filter, it assumes the observation is a linear
    function of the state plus Gaussian noise, and the target
    data at time t is assumed to be a linear function of the
    target data at the previous time instant plus Gaussian noise.

    The Kalman filter algorithm implements a discrete time,
    linear State-Space System described as follows.

        x(t) = A * x(t-1) + r(t-1)           (state equation)
        z(t) = H * x(t) + q(t)               (measurement equation)

    The Kalman filter algorithm involves two steps.
        - Predict: Using the previous states to predict the
                   current state.
        - Update:  Using the current measurement, such as the
                   recorded neural signal, to correct the state.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fast_compute : bool, optional
        If fast compute is True, use the torch.linalg.lstsq function to
        compute the matrix needed, this method is not support to compute the
        gradient. Otherwise, manually computing the function by inverse.
    eps : float, optional
        In case of during the computation, X'X is not full rank,
        the eps is added on the diagnol of the covariance matrix
        to make sure it always have inverse matrix.
